## Description

Pokemon Explorer is a mobile application designed to allow users to explore and discover detailed information about different Pok√©mon. Users can search for Pok√©mon by name, explore a complete list of Pok√©mon, and view details such as statistics, types, abilities, and more.

## Key Features

- Detailed details of each Pok√©mon, including statistics, types, abilities, and more.
- Intuitive and easy-to-use user interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Android**: The application is developed using the Kotlin programming language and the Android SDK.
- **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication.
- **Retrofit**: To make calls to the PokeAPI and retrieve information about the Pok√©mon.
- **Glide**: For loading images of the Pok√©mon.
- **Palette**: To extract dominant colors from Pok√©mon images and enhance the user interface.
- **ViewModel and LiveData**: For the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture that separates UI presentation logic from the user interface.

## libreries SKYDOVES

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.skydoves:progressview:1.1.3"
    implementation "com.github.skydoves:androidribbon:1.0.4"
    implementation("com.github.skydoves:transformationlayout:1.1.3")
}
```

## Architecture
**Pokedex** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

- **Model**: Represents the data and logic of the application. In this case, fetching data from the PokeAPI.
- **View**: The user interface of the application, which displays the data and receives user interaction.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It contains presentation logic and communicates with the Model to fetch and update data.
